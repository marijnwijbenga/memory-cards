# Description

This is a Super Mario themed memory card game made with Angular & Tailwind.

### Explanation
From a grid of 4x4 memory cards you try to find the common pairs in as few turns
as possible. If you find all pairs with 16 turns you score the max score of 1000 points.  If you use more than 16 turns the score goes down. 

### Concepts used
With this project I tried to focus on the proper use of a JS framework to maintain readability of code and re-usability of the components.
I focussed on working with Inputs & Outputs, content projection with ng-content and named slots.


## Run local dev server
1. clone this project  
2. cd memory-cards
3. npm install   
4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
